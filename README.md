# LiFi Pro Transmitter

This project demonstrates the basic concept of LiFi (Light Fidelity)
optical wireless communication.

## Project Description
LiFi is a technology that uses light to transmit data instead of
traditional radio frequency signals.

In this project, data can be represented as binary values (0 / 1)
and transmitted using optical pulses.

A light sensor such as an LDR can be used on the receiver side to
detect and decode the transmitted signal.

## Technologies
- Android (Kotlin)
- Optical Communication (LiFi Concept)
- Embedded Systems (LDR Receiver Concept)

## Purpose
This project was prepared as an academic demonstration for
educational purposes.

## APK
The compiled APK file is included in the repository for demonstration.
